            <p>The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) is a very large herbivore with thick, almost hairless skin; a long,
                flexible, prehensile trunk; upper incisors forming long, curved, ivory tusks; and large, fan-shaped ears. 
                There are two distinct species of African elephant: the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and 
                the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana). Elephants are difficult to hunt because, despite their large size,
                 they are able to hide in tall grass and are more likely to charge than the other Big Five species. 
                 They become aggressive when their young ones are being mistreated or their view of their young is being blocked.

            <p>The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) is a large herbivore with two upright horns on its nasal bridge. Its thick (1.5–5 cm), 
                protective skin is formed from layers of collagen arranged in a lattice structure, and is very hard to puncture. Because it is 
                now critically endangered, hunting is extremely limited. In the context of big-game hunting in Africa, the term "rhinoceros" may 
                also refer to the white rhinoceros, but among big-five game hunters, the black rhinoceros is more highly prized.</p>

    <p>The African buffalo or Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is a large horned bovid. It is the only animal among the Big Five 
        that is not on the “endangered” or “threatened” list.[11] The Cape buffalo is considered by many to be the most dangerous 
        to hunters of any of the Big Five:[12] Wounded buffalos have reportedly been known to ambush and attack their pursuers.</p>

    <p>The African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) is a large, carnivorous feline. Its fur may be either black, or tawny with 
        dark rosette-shaped markings. The leopard is considered the most difficult of the Big Five to hunt because of its nocturnal
         habits (it is most active between sunset and sunrise, although it may hunt during the day in some areas), and because it is 
         wary of humans and will take flight in the face of danger. Leopards can be found in the savanna grasslands, brush land and 
         forested areas in Africa. Among the Big Five, they are the most difficult animals to acquire a hunting license for.</p>

    <P>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large, carnivorous feline found in Africa and northwest India. It has a short, tawny coat;
        a tufted tail; and, in the male, a heavy mane around the neck and shoulders. Lions are desirable to hunters because of the very real danger 
       involved in hunting them.</P>
